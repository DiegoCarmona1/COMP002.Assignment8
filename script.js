console.log(

// 2. Write a console.log() statement that answers the following question: What would you
// change about the course?

console.log("What would you change about the course?");
console.log("Most of my lack of understanding could have been resolved if I had shown up to the class and actively participated alongside the instructor who could have cleared up my confusion and helped me familiarized myself easier, as such any struggles I had are due of my own.");

// 3. Write a console.log() statement that answers the following question: Did you learn
// what you expected to learn in this course?

console.log("Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?");
console.log("I had no expectation coming into this course, as such everything I learned was new, refreshing, and albeit frustrating. Exploring a whole new world is far more complex than one could realize.");

// 4. Write a console.log() statement that answers the following question: What concepts
// were new to you and what concepts had you encountered already in the past?

console.log(
  "What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you encountered already in the past?"
);
console.log("All concepts I encountered were new, I rarely found anything I had prior experience with. Although, I can confidently say that along the path to my mastery I found the details of javascript functions to become more vivid in the online actions and sites I would visit regularly. I hope to continue improving.");
